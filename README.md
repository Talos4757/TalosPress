TalosPress
==================

This is the WordPress theme we use on our [website](http://talos4757.org). It is licensed under GPL v2 and based on the free version of the [GeneratePress](http://generatepress.com) theme (licensed under GPL v2 as well).
This theme is tweaked for our needs, especially support for RTL webpages.
